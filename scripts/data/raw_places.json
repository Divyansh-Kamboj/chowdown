The quality of the food is clearly very high, there menu ranges from sandwiches to breakfast stables to seasonal dishes like crepes and such. I personally have been here around 3 times, the environment is very very busy on the weekends, however the service is fast and attentive to whatever your needs are. I dont have a photo of it, but they have a toppings bar with some of the best whipped cream I've had - it also has a plethora of fresh berries. Overall great spot for brunch with the parents, I would recommend getting a reservation before you go for sure.",

        "text": "Was looking to catch up with some of my best girl friends over a girly brunch and stumbled upon Portage Bay in the University District. I seriously did not realize how popular this place was--but wow, I get the hype.\n\nFirst tip: MAKE A RESERVATION ON OPENTABLE. I was lucky enough to snag one (bless), and even with a reservation, we waited around 15 minutes to be seated. It was a Sunday brunch, so we expected a bit of chaos, but it still felt overwhelming. There was a line out the door with people waiting outside, the level of noise in the space is quite loud. While waiting for our table or even seated at our table, it was a bit hard to hear one another. This is not the space for a quiet girly brunch for sure. That said--would say the food is 100% worth it.\n\nDon't come hungry or hangry as it did take close to an hour for our food to arrive (yes, we were HANGRY), but when it did, the first ten minutes was silence of devouring our meal. Service was okay, the servers seem uninterested to be there, barely checked in - we had to ask about status of our food and get his attention.\n\nWe ordered the Smoked Salmon Benedict, Seattle Benedict (with Dungeness crab!), 2 Rancher Breakfasts (3 eggs your way, house potatoes, one with chicken sausage + pancake, the other with bacon + French toast). Honestly such a cute idea to do a berry bar, the menu lists items that gives you access to a literal berry buffet--fresh berries, whipped cream, butter...\n\nThe benedicts were the best menu choice--rich, flavorful, and perfectly portioned. The Rancher Breakfasts were huge and hearty--perfect for anyone rolling in with major hunger. The chicken sausage was flavorful and the potatoes were crispy on the outside, soft on the inside.\n\nI am a BIG pancake girly, and their pancakes were giant, fluffy, with the perfect hint of sweetness. I ate my entire meal plus one pancake and still had leftovers for dinner and breakfast the next day. No regrets.\n\nThe coffee here is just okay. Seattle has no shortage of amazing coffee shops, would recommend saving your caffeine intake for one of those instead--which we did, shoutout Ugly Mug Coffee, which was the move.",

All the staff I interacted with were wonderful.\nI was really disappointed by my experience here. I'm a HUGE eggs Benedict fan and I have consistently been recommended this establishment for their renditions of this dish. I made a reservation, and though I got to the restaurant on time, I was told I would need to wait an extra fifteen minutes due to the restaurant being busy (to be fair, it was very busy. But then what was the point of my reservation which I made weeks in advance?). A positive was when we did get seated, our food came out rather quickly. And I want to say I liked it, but I was thoroughly disappointed with my Benedict. I felt their English muffin was heavy and biscuit-y in texture, but by far the worst was that both of my poached eggs had hard yolks (not by my request). The carnitas were a mix of some perfect bites, and some incredibly dry ones. I would say that I was disappointed by the quality of my meal, considering the reviews I've gotten previously.\nOnce again, the staff were excellent people, and they sure know how to handle business! I just wish my experience could have been better.",

        "text": "Had the pork verde nachos here along with a couple of beers. These nachos came in a massive plate - the portion size was a bit excessive to be honest.\nThere was a ton of cheese - comprising the vast majority of the toppings on the chips. The pork was probably the second-most present, followed by jalapenos\n\nThe cheese was probably the only decent thing here. It really was melted well onto the chips, and I got a pretty good cheese pull with each bite.\nHowever, the rest of it was not great. I did not like the pork - as it felt pretty dry, and without its juiciness lost most of its flavor. The chips themselves were fine - a little bit stale but decently crunchy.\n\nWhat was truly terrible was the salsa verde. This just tasted like water that looked green. I don't know what was in this but it might've been the worst salsa I've ever had.\n\nOverall, I like most things about this brewery, but ordering the nachos will have you regretting your decision less-than-halfway through. 4/10",

        "text": "Went to Big Time Brewery last night, as it was the only thing open around 10pm toward the bottom of The Ave. We were going to go to Cafe on The Ave for a coffee and a bite to eat, since usually they’re open late. However they were closed.\n\nWe deliberated for a bit before going in, but ultimately decided to give it a chance.\n\nWe noticed that we needed to order at the bar, so we walked back to where a very pleasant gal greeted us. She had a great smile and warm welcoming vibe, which sold me on the place :) She patiently waited while we went over menu options. They have a very extensive menu, so it took us some time.  One of us is a strict vegan, and thankfully they had some great options available for her :) We finally landed on the vegan pizza, which she brought over to our table up front near the window, she even brought us cutlery and napkins which was just an extra level of  service that I personally really appreciated!\n\nThe atmosphere was super chill not crazy busy or packed, which was nice, so we could do what we set out to do there in the first place, which was to discuss our weekly night Metal Mondayze up at Innervisions. I took over the iconic poster shop, along with Ken Tomkins from Seattle Records.\n\nWe didn’t have a whole lot of time to spend, but we sure were able to maximize it due to the friendly service, and being able to hold a conversation without a bunch of distractions.\n\nI would highly recommend\nBIG Time Brewery!\n\nI even noticed when I’d walked by before, people were even playing Chess! That’s an added bonus and another reason to return, as Ken who I mentioned before, owns Seattle Records and just happens to be a chess grandmaster :)\n\nThanks again for having the absolute gem of a business going at the bottom of The Ave!",

Extremely tiny portions, maybe they were trying to stretch what they had left. Still got charged the same amount. Staff was super obnoxious, e.g. instead of asking if we wanted white or brown rice, one server said, “do you want the zeezee or the zaazaa?” while laughing his head off with his friend. Peak humor, my guy. I ordered a tortilla on the side, and they forgot to include it. My friend found a large piece of plastic in his bowl. They were out of forks. There was garbage all over the floor. Note that all of this was more than 2 hours before their closing time.",

It is close and convenient, and the prices are reasonable, and the food is quite good. There's a subtle German charm here that I rather appreciate. I usually have a Philly cheese steak when I order, as I am a aficionado of such, and the ones here are savory, though not of the quality that one has in Philly. There's nothing wrong with this place, and there are a lot of things right about it, and compared to Cafe on the Ave, it is much more of an actual restaurant that a mature adult would willingly want to spend a significant amount of time in. I would not say that it is excellent in either food or atmosphere, but it is very good, and it is reliable. I have come here before, and I will come here again certainly.",

I got their hot wing sauce and it was good! Had a nice kick to it. My friend loved his gumbo and the sandwich bread that came with it. The soft pretzel and beer cheese was amazing as well!\nOverall, great food. Good beer selection.

Here’s why you should belly up at Finn MacCools: For Guinness lovers,  Finn MacCools is a haven. The taps flow with the dark elixir, and the pints are poured with care. Whether you’re nursing a pint solo or clinking glasses with friends, the Guinness here is as authentic as it gets. There is always something happening here for events so check out their website to see what is happening. Watch all the UW games here. Don’t expect gourmet dishes; Finn MacCools keeps it simple.

They have daily specials and happy hour so it’s a great spot for cheap bar food. The service was good too and the employee was extremely nice. We went on a Saturday afternoon, so it wasn’t very busy. On game days and events, it’s usually packed!",

        "text": "The first time I went to this place the food and service were exceptional. I ordered the garlic fried rice and everything was on point. The staff was very nice and made every effort to get feedback and engage with the guests. Around a week later, I went for the second time and was extremely disappointed. As me and my friend walked in, we waited at the door for a bit to see if someone was going to assign us a table. Nobody did, and we proceeded to seat ourselves at a random table. The waiter, who was an older man, approached our table and was very confrontational and belligerent. He instructed us that they do not allow guests to seat themselves and that from next time we should wait to be assigned a seat. It must be noted that there was only 1 table at the whole restaurant that was occupied. His tone was very aggressive and all the other guests at the restaurant stopped eating to look at how he was talking to us. I am not sure there is going to be a next time. Anyways, as we sat down he reluctantly brought us 2 menus. We deliberated if we should still proceed to eat here, and agreed that we should just leave. After we left, he tried to follow us out of the restaurant, the purpose of which I do not know. I am sure this is a problem that can be fixed easily, although I’m not going to state the obvious and let the owners decide what that looks like.",

We ordered the drunken noodles and Panang curry, both hot, as well as the papaya salad and two sides of rice. Neither main dish was spicy at all but the papaya salad was, which was nice at least.\n\nThe drunken noodles were hammered while cooking to the point where the “noodles” were mushy and falling apart into goo.

I got the phad see ew with fried tofu, and my partner got the Thai pulled pork. Our server was Pete, but someone else came by to take our order and bring our food out. The phad see eq was delicious. I do not usually get tofu with this dish, but I decided to try something different. The tofu went really well with the noodles, egg, cabbage, and broccoli. The Thai pulled pork was absolutely delicious! It came with some sort of dipping sauce that was equally delicious. We had a really nice meal here, and our dishes both were under $15 which made it a reasonably-priced dinner. They also have some fish tanks which looked well-maintained and very nice.

Got the Tom Yum soup here once and the chicken Jungle Curry another time and wasn’t a fan of either. I think I liked the red curry more. The Jungle curry tasted a lot like fish sauce and the chicken lacked flavor.",

Loved the chili sauce it came with. The takoyaki was a little too soft for me, but it was due to steam from the package. The noodle type was not my favorite but I am glad I gave it try to know now. I loved the soft boiled egg. I think this would be a better place to go into and enjoy for sure.\nI did appreciate the different options for soup bases. Give it a go but in person.",

The BBQ beef is my favorite and the Kimchi pancakes are incredible (although I must say Moodoo’s is better). Chicken with cheese was a little dry to my liking. Soondubu is great according to my gf although I have never been a fan of it. Toppoki and Japchae are other dishes I like. I go back there every time and always get the BBQ beef - highly recommended!",

It's like a hoagie roll and was dry. I had their banh mi at the SLU location last year and that bread wasn't great either but this is on another level. There are Vietnamese bakeries and delis that make Vietnamese baguettes in Seattle that can supply so this is not excusable imo. Other Vietnamese restaurants can get the right bread, why not here. As for the fillings, it's ok. Ingredients are fresh. Not the most flavorful chicken but I did appreciate that there was plenty of meat and veggies.\nI also had a rice bowl here, reminiscent of com tam. Rice bowl was much better, though fish sauce was just ok.\nWorkers were kind and speedy but interaction was minimal.\nAt the end of the day, it's like chipotle to Mexican food. It's not authentic really (they asked if I wanted fish sauce with the sandwich which was odd—never encountered that before in America or Vietnam) but it works I guess. I'm not gonna come back when there's other smaller Viet restaurants in the u-district I can support UNLESS the bread situation improves.",

The food was tasty, fresh, and full of authentic flavor. Everything was packed neatly, and the service was fast\n\nThe prices are very reasonable for the quality and generous portions. I especially enjoyed the Poori with Potato Masala and the Masala Dosa, both were cooked perfectly and flavorful. The restaurant clearly takes care to maintain quality and consistency.\n\nThe only downside was that parking was a bit challenging to find, which made picking up the order slightly stressful. However, once parked, everything went smoothly, and the staff was friendly and helpful.\n\nOverall, Chili’s is a reliable spot for quick, flavorful South Indian food. Despite the minor inconvenience with parking, I’ll definitely be ordering again and would recommend it to anyone looking for fresh, well-prepared Indian cuisine.",

However, our experience ended on a very uncomfortable note. Before leaving, we spoke with a lady at the counter and paid our bill. But as we were walking out, our server — a young lady — stopped us in front of many other customers and asked if we had paid. It was embarrassing and made us feel very awkward. This situation could have been handled more politely and professionally. A quick check before approaching us like that would have been much more respectful.",

Butter is the cheapest thing you can get -- be a bit more generous.\n\nI would strongly suggest that the chef/establishment should try a little harder.

        "text": "This family restaurant named for the iconic (and sadly endangered) Lebanese Cedar Tree has been a staple of Seattle since 1974 and the U-District since 1976. Over the past 50 years it has been serving delicious Lebanese food in one of the most collective international foodie locations in the City of Seattle! It's steadfast history will be made all the more obvious when you taste the delicious  cuisine of the Eastern Mediterranean. I had the Shawarma Plate with a Turkish Coffee and my partner had the Shish Kebob Enree. Both were served with generous portions, were packed full of excellent spice flavours, and came over rice, a side of delicious fattoush salad, and pita bread. The service was fast and one of the friendliest I have had in my past seven years of living in Seattle. They also have a take out window and outdoor seating. I highly recommend and will be back soon with friends. ❤️🇱🇧❤️",

        "text": "Based on preliminary research, Cedars of Lebanon, which was established in 1974, is the only restaurant still open from when I went to school at UW in the mid-1980s. I don’t recall visiting there when I was a student so I decided to go there for lunch. It is a cramped restaurant with beautiful murals on the wall and supplies stored in booths. I ordered the Gyros Plate, which I thought was the famous sandwich of lamb, veggies, wrapped in pita bread. However, the “plate” is lamb, veggies, rice, and pita bread on the side…kind of a deconstructed Gyro sandwich. I happily ate my meal while reconstructing mini gyros. It was good and the service was great!",

My first time here, and I've already caught conversations with customers who have been coming by for 3 decades.\n\nWe ordered falafel wraps, foul mudammas, and greek fries.

The interior decor is...let's say it has a hole-in-the-wall charm to it. This place is set-up for takeaway orders through the window that faces the street; so I can appreciate the interior being a lower priority. The staff is kind and prompt. The gyros were delicious with a healthy portion of meat and just the right amount of sauce. The pricing is better than the Greek restaurant near my building where they charge two dollars more per gyro. I'll definitely eat here again.",

I’m not paying $5 for something I can get for free at the university.\n\nOn top of that, the staff doesn’t seem to know the menu well. As a coffee enthusiast, I asked for a specific espresso combination to make the drink sweeter, yet they still served me plain coffee for $5, again. This has happened three times now. After a few sips, I end up throwing the drink away right outside the shop.\n\nUnless the staff gets proper training about the menu and coffees and improves their communication, I’ll be taking my business to other cafés (and recommending my friends to do the same).",

Their paneer and veggie burgers are the real stars of the menu: simple, fresh, and downright delicious. The paneer  is flavorful and perfectly seasoned, while the veggie burger strikes that balance of slight crunch, hearty goodness that makes you wonder why you ever needed meat in the first place. The menu isn’t overly complicated, and that’s exactly what makes it great—just good food done right.\n\nWhat truly sets Burger Hut apart is its late-night availability and relaxed vibe. Whether you’re wrapping up a study session or stumbling out from a party in the U-District, this place becomes the go-to spot to satisfy both your hunger and your mood. It’s one of those places where every bite feels comforting, where the food hits just right at 1 a.m., and where a simple burger can make your night feel complete.

I watched the cook pulling beef patties out of a box that was on the ground, no gloves being used and the cook was pulling earwax out of his ear while at the grill. Not a care in the world.\nThe total lack of hygiene was astounding.\nI paid for my food when I ordered and didn’t even ask for my money back, I just left.\nI highly recommend not eating at this establishment if you care about sanitation.",

        "text": "I ate here for the first time today. I went around 12:30pm, and was the only customer. My burger was made to order, as were the fries. The young man at the counter was friendly enough, but I think a language barrier had him a bit slow on understanding my order. That was fine, he was earnestly trying.\nThe good: my burger tasted pretty good! The fries were nice and hot! The lettuce was kinda brown and wilty. But the slice of tomato seemed good and the burger was cooked medium-well, which is my preference.\nThe bad: Folks, this place is not clean. From the front door to the peek behind the curtain into the kitchen, to the all-gender bathroom, it looks like they view “cleaning” to be a quick wipe with a damp towel - at best.\nThe front door is grimy and the window needs to be cleaned. There’s a thin film of yuk on the tables. And guys, come on, the bathroom had a bottle of spray cleaner sitting on the toilet tank with two meager napkins, but neither the toilet nor the sink had been wiped down in some time. There was no handsoap, no hand towels, and the air dryer was not working. That’s just gross.\nThe whole place needs a deep cleaning.\nNow, I love me some greasy diner type joints as much as the next guy. And your burger was pretty good. Show some pride. Clean up the place.\nI will return here in spite of my detracting comments. If it’s clean and the food is still good, I will be a recurring customer. If not, I won’t be back.\n\nUPDATE: I went today (10/22) months after my first visit. I’m conflicted.\nOn one hand the guy who wrote down my order and cooked it got it very wrong. However, to his enormous credit, when he noticed it, he volunteered a genuine apology. And I told him thanks, I really appreciated it, but I will eat it anyway. I had already started eating, and the thing is, the burger tasted good. The fries were very hot. The guy is busting his tail, making everything one order at a time. It’s a burger, and this ain’t Canlis. The day I go full Karen over a wrong order is the day my villain origin story begins. Ain’t happening.\n\nThe flip side is nothing is any more clean than my first visit. This time I took a photo of the bathroom situation. Now the paltry paper towels are sitting on an extra roll of TP. There’s still no paper towels to dry hands on. The tables are grimy.\n\nBottom line: the food tasted good, the guy is working really hard, and I respect the heck out of him. But I recommend you take your order to go, because sitting in there to eat is gross.",

Service a little slow, got food around 120, but I didn't really mind because I got to check up on stuff for classes tomorrow.\n\nI wasn't sure what to exactly expect with the eggplant burger but I've been looking to get more into eggplant lately so I thought I'd explore a potential use case. Burger came on a sesame seed bun with roasted eggplant, cheese, mayo, ketchup, lettuce, tomato, pickles, and some sort of chili sauce akin to sambal olek. The burger was delicious. The fries were good and I could imagine them being even better with some sort of garlicky sauce rather than ketchup. They had some sort of masala and paired well with the burger.\n\nI'd like to return and potentially check out the paneer masala burger, and maybe a different fry option. Overall very good spot and will be back.",

But if there’s one thing I can rely on when I’m in the depths of a horrible hangover or need a greasy reward, it’s the Nasai Teriyaki fried gyoza. Although I do feel that they are overpriced, they are consistently fried to absolute perfection. The outside is crunchy, while the inside is still juicy. The filling has a good flavor and is never dry, too squishy, or chewy. The pictures speak for themselves, just look at that golden color.\n\nWhen I went the service was unreasonably slow. 6 gyoza took probably 15 minutes. I was in line, and it seemed that many customers had been waiting even longer for their food.\n\nAgain, I haven’t tried anything else and I don’t really plan on it…but I’d highly recommend trying the fried gyoza at least once.",

After calling, the owners were very kind to let me know that they had WiFi available for paying customers. As this was surprisingly rare for other restaurants I called in for, I got myself some kimchi stew and set myself up at the table.\n\nThere is lots of seating available and you order at a self-serve kiosk near the entrance. The entrance is very accessible and they can host a variety of party sizes. Just make sure you let them know ahead of time if you are going to have a large group!\n\nThe stew had just the right flavors and came with kimichi and rice. For the price, I was very happy since I’d been eating lots of overpriced food since I landed here for my trip. They were quick with the meal prep, offered plenty of food for one, and offered wonderful customer service. They also have a bathroom that is accessible for paying customers! Couldn’t think of any place better to get some home cooked Korean dishes.",

Beautiful restaurant well-kept and clean, the interior is breathable and welcoming all in all bringing the aesthetics of the store together making it complete. My new favorite burger spot!\nI ordered the onion rings, Bacon cheeseburger, fries and drink only having to wait ~5 minutes for my meal. Cashier was very helpful, soft-spoken but held a fun conversation until my food arrived!\nBurger was delicious and blows anything in its vicinity out of the water, no competition. They have a lovely in-house sauce but how many customization options. The portioning was fair and it still held up even when I ate it cold.\nOverall I have to give it a 5/5 because I don't know what they can improve on! I have a lot of faith in the cook and can't wait to come back and try the whole menu.",

That wrinkly, thin, layered rice sheets pleasantly wrap the filling ingredients and also hold the sweet soy sauce effectively, is something you’d find in a hole in the wall, mom and pop corner restaurant/ food stand in my hometown. The wonton soups is a steal for $8, and tastes authentic and it’s perfect for the cold weather. All in all, I’m exited to reorder from this spot!",

It doesn't taste like any Taiwanese style popcorn chicken I have had before.  I wasted $10.99 and just threw that away.  The spicy powder is bitter.  I also ordered the mala pork feet rice noodle to go.  When I got home, I found out there is no pork feet, only 2 pieces of fish balls in it, soup no flavor and not spicy.  This place is horrible.   I tried to call them and see if I can get a refund.  No answer!!!",

This place is a self serve style restaurant.\n\nThe two critiques I have on this restaurant is the communication/ service and the food.\n\nThe food itself was good. We ordered the Katsu and sushi. Although, we weren't served any water for the period we were there.\nWe finished our food and went up to pay. We weren't checked on to see if anything was wrong. The only interactions were through our food being served and paying.\n\nNow as we went to pay, gratuity was added on top of our meal. I  see this as a bit of confusion as to the only service was through bringing the food to us. after I go into pay, I sit down and the owner comes up. They questioned why we didn't tip and demanded a tip from us. They kept pushing for a tip until we did and left. Overall, I didn't hate the experience, but I think demanding tip after the service that was given to us is not fair. I want my interaction in a restaurant to feel like we are coming into a welcoming environment. I would be glad to tip if more service was provided, although, that just did not happen. If you come here for the food, great. If you come here for an experience, I recommend not.",

The total was already around $50 for 2 orders (tax included). His reasoning was because they do the dishes and it was \"america style\" to tip, also insulted her by asking if our parents didn't teach us to tip. Maybe his intention was not to insult her but it was rude to say so. Although the food was good, the service wasn't great.",

The portions are generous, and the prices are quite reasonable. I've paid almost twice as much for lower-quality burgers elsewhere, so they're definitely doing a commendable job here. We ordered the husky buryger and a husky burger combo, which were delightful. Please excuse the low-light photo – capturing a good shot in a car can be a challenge!",

It is a nice place to chill with friends or to study when taking a break between classes.\n\nThe menu is very fresh, offering a wide range of vegetables and meats. I did not have any issues with the freshness of the vegetables, and the area was very clean, which I appreciated. The menu items are quite standard for most sushi places, offering things like California or tuna rolls. There are only a few options for vegetarians, such as the Vegan Roll. However, the place offers customization and unlimited toppings, which is very welcoming.\n\nI would definitely recommend the customization option so you can find what is right for you. I wish I had tried the customization myself, but the Vegan Roll was not bad either.\n\nI got mine with the spicy mayo and it was a surprise! The spice balanced well with the raw vegetables, and each bite got better and better. One thing I wished for was a seasoning option. Having plain salt, pepper, sesame, pickled ginger, or wasabi would be nice. I enjoy flavorful food, so I was a bit bummed that there was no extra seasoning. I had to rely on the mayo and seaweed for flavor instead. This is probably just a personal preference since I enjoy seasoning so much. However, everything else was good. The menu is straightforward, and the place is fast and clean.",

First time seeing a self serve boba place and was a bit hesitant at first because of the possibly of low quality boba, but very glad we were wrong! It was very fun to taste the flavors, many places have done away with sample cups, but so happy this place did not. Was very pleasantly surprised by the rose milk tea, a suggestion form someone else taste testing as well. The jelly and pudding toppings were plentiful!! Finding the actual boba was a little hard, not in obvious place with the jelly, it was in a container off to the side next to topping station, and the boba was very nice as well, not too soft or chewing. There was even a place to add more sweet syrup to adjust sweetness. Got all our favorites plus new rose milk tea!  After you fill your cup, they will seal for you and enjoy!\nPrice well too! The place is a great hang out spot with games and wifi. Highly recommend!",

The service was impressively quick, with our food arriving within 10 minutes. The beef soup was served extremely hot.\nEach main dish came with a bowl of rice. The beef I had with the bibimbap was fresh and delicious. We received a generous assortment of sides, including kimchi, fish cake, potato, seaweed salad, horseradish, and pasta. The teriyaki tofu was sweet, simple and well made. The soup was simple and mildly flavored, but it complemented the rice well. Overall, it was a great experience; the restaurant was clean and had a pleasant atmosphere. Will visit again.",

Even in the small there is plenty of tofu and veggies! I hate when I order pho and there’s only like 3 cubes of tofu on top. So I love coming here. The broth is so good, and I genuinely feel rejuvenated after eating their pho. Like I’m convinced it can cure any illness. I only gave 4 stars for atmosphere because the spray they use to clean the tables has a strong smell, and recently the door sometimes gets stuck open, letting the cold air inside. But the pho is so amazing I don’t really care, I will go anyways. They also do take-out orders!! Also it’s a family business so I love supporting them. Highly recommend!!",

Not quite what you get on the streets of Mumbai, but enjoyable. (Still not sure why places keep adding onions to vada pav — that’s not how it’s traditionally done 🙃).\n•\tPav Bhaji: Just okay — didn’t capture that bold, buttery street-style flavor.\n•\tNoodle Tikki Burger: A fun twist! Crisp tikki with well-seasoned noodles made it a nice bite.\n•\tChole Puri: Excellent — puris were fried perfectly, and the chole had just the right masala balance.\n•\tVeg Fried Rice: Surprisingly good, flavorful without being greasy.\n•\tPaneer Manchurian: Decent, though not the classic Indo-Chinese flavor bomb.\n•\tMasala Chai: Skip this one — lacks the punch of proper kadak chai.\n\n🪑 Ambience & Service\n\nThe ambience is pretty basic and doesn’t give off any Indian street-food vibes. It’s a self-serve setup, but the food comes out quickly and efficiently.\n\n📌 Overall\n\nA nice spot to check out once if you’re in the neighborhood. Everything is reasonably good, but nothing really makes me want to return when there are better Indian options around the Seattle area.\n\nStill, I’ll give them a solid 3⭐ for the effort they’ve put into recreating Mumbai street food vibes.",

But after the first sip, you’ll know that this is some real quality matcha.\n\nThe cashier even shared that the shop doesn’t make much profit from the drinks— but it’s really about the owners dream of sharing the authentic matcha experience with others.\n\nBeautiful space, and amazing drink. I’ll absolutely be coming back to try more of their menu",

I was told the only pistachio part was the foam, which was made with real pistachios and would be buttery. It turned out quite grainy and messed with the texture of the drink. The drink was also too watery so not enough oat milk was added. It didn’t have a lot of flavor to it in general, couldn’t taste the pistachio. Expect to spend 10 dollars on a regular tasting matcha.",

The matcha bomb contained two shots of vietnamese coffee, matcha from Yame, and had a salty cream foam with it. The matcha bomb was amazing! I was hesistant at first because I never seen a combination like this, but I was able to taste all the ingredients without one overpowering one another.  The earl grey matcha was also great. The earl grey tea was strong and noticiable while also retaining the matcha blended into it as well. Would come back to try their other drinks as well!",

There was barely any veggies. The noodles were room temperature, like they had been precooked and not fried in a wok. They stuck together and were in a red bland sweet sauce. I have NO IDEA how a thai restaurant can survive when their most famous dish is this bad. I frequent other thai restaraunts in the area and ANY OF THEM know how to make pad thai. I'll stick with thai tom it is literally night and day. Do better",

        "text": "I visited this poke place recently, hoping to grab a quick, fresh meal. Unfortunately, my experience left a lot to be desired.\n\nLet’s start with the positive: the staff was friendly and efficient. They greeted me as soon as I walked in and were happy to answer any questions I had. Even as the line started to build up, they kept things moving smoothly, which I appreciated. Service was definitely a bright spot in an otherwise lackluster visit.\n\nHowever, the quality of the food was a major letdown. The fish in my poke bowl didn’t taste fresh at all. The texture was off, and there was an unpleasant odor that made it hard to enjoy the meal. Freshness is key for a place that serves poke, and unfortunately, this was far from what I expected. I couldn’t even finish the bowl because the fish just didn’t sit right.\n\nThe cleanliness of the space was another issue. The restaurant itself felt a bit neglected—sticky counters, tables that hadn’t been wiped down, and a general sense that the place could use a serious cleaning. It wasn’t what I expected from a restaurant that specializes in raw fish, where hygiene is a top priority.\n\nWhile the service was definitely up to par, the food quality and the cleanliness of the space need major improvements. I was really hoping for a better experience, especially considering how convenient the location is. But given this visit, I won’t be coming back again.",

        "text": "I recently dined at Poke Bay and was thoroughly impressed by the freshness of their seafood. The fish in my poke bowl tasted like it was caught that very morning—firm, succulent, and full of flavor. Every bite was a testament to their commitment to quality. The variety on the menu was equally impressive, with an array of toppings and sauces that allowed me to customize my bowl to my exact liking. It's refreshing to see such a wide selection of fresh vegetables and unique mix-ins that go beyond the typical offerings. The staff's recommendations were spot-on, guiding me to create a bowl that was both nutritious and indulgent. The generous portions left me feeling satisfied without being heavy, and the vibrant, crisp ingredients made the meal an absolute delight. Poke Bay has certainly set the bar high for poke in the city!",

        "text": "I'm from Hawaii, so I'm always on the lookout for the next new poke spot. Poke Bay just opened on the Ave (right in front of Boba Gem and across from Jai Thai) and they were having a 20% off sale for their grand opening, so I popped in to give them a try!\n\nTL;DR: It's not authentic Hawaiian-style poke. However, it's a decent American-style poke bowl (where the poke isn't pre-mixed beforehand and the toppings greatly outweigh the amount of fish). I'd come back solely for the unusual fact that they have crawfish and shrimp tempura in their standard protein options.\n\nThe interior is bright, clean, and minimalist -- just a bar to order and some seating. One individual bathroom. Note that there is VERY LIMITED seating: 1 table for four people, 1 table for two people, and 5 counter seats. When I came in, they were playing a mix of alternative and Disney music at medium volume.\n\nIn terms of food, it was pretty standard Seattle poke-bowl fare and pricing. Choose a \"signature bowl\" with pre-set ingredients (Regular $13.99 and Large $16.99) or build your own bowl (Regular $13.99 for 2 proteins, Large $16.99 for 3 proteins, +$3 for an extra scoop of protein). They had drinks to purchase but I didn't see a free water dispenser.\n\nFor folks unfamiliar with poke bowls, here's how to build your own bowl:\n1. Walk to the far right edge of the counter, and tell them what size you want.\n2. Choose a base (rices and salad), 2-3 scoops of protein (variety of cubed fishes, shrimp tempura, crawfish, or tofu).\n3. Add an unlimited number of sides (vegetables, crab salad, edamame, ginger, etc).\n4. Choose your sauce (I'm unclear if there's an extra charge for multiple sauces or not).\n5. Add an unlimited number of toppings (crispy onion, jalapeños, tempura flakes, etc).\n\nEnjoy!",

I didn’t like the house shoyu either, the rice was clumping, and the toppings weren’t fresh (lots of browning) or very appetizing. It doesn’t compare at all to the other nearby poke places. There’s also no AC, so on hot days you’d need to find somewhere else to sit. The owners seemed very nice but unfortunately I can’t recommend this place.",

You can choose your own noodles if you order a soup and they have several different options to choose from. You order from a kiosk then sit down and wait for your number to be called. We didn’t wait long and food comes out pretty quickly. You pick it up at the counter then you bus your own table. Utensils and napkins are in a hidden drawer at the end of the table. I wish there were signs telling us that! I also wish they had actual soup spoons. Instead they have flimsy, plastic spoons. Overall, though, pretty good flavor and big portions!",

        "text": "Qingshu Hot Pot is a malatang - “you pay for what you eat” - style restaurant. You grab a plate and tongs, select your ingredients for your hotpot soup, and the staff weigh your ingredients to determine the price. The base price is $14.99 / 1lb and the minimum weight you can get is 0.8 lb.\n\nThey had a decent variety of ingredients spanning from vegetables, noodles, protein, and seafood. Some of the ingredients had labels (the meats and several of the seafood options) but some others did not, so as long as you’re familiar with what malatang restaurants generally serve, then picking the right ingredients that suite your palate shouldn’t be too difficult. Hopefully as the restaurant gains more recognition, the ingredient variety can expand. One of the favorite toppings was the mochi fish cake (tastes nothing special but had a unique texture) and the lobster ball (fishball filled with lobster flavored roe).\n\nBroth selection was vast with a whopping 9 different broths to choose from. After paying for the meal, the staff cooks your ingredients with your chosen broth and they bring your bowl to you. Mid-meal, the staff brought me the noodles they forgot to put into my soup and they were very apologetic about it. Funnily enough, I didn’t even notice they forgot my noodles but seeing how quick they were to address the mistake shows how much they put in towards giving their customers the best service.\n\nOverall, my experience visiting Qingshu Hot Pot was a good one. I recommend people to visit here! :)",

I ordered a tandoori variety plate to taste all of the proteins. The fish and ground beef were wonderful. The chicken was flavorful, if a bit dry. The lamb was too chewy for my liking but the flavor was spot on. The sauces were a highlight of the meal, as was the naan. Chef's kiss. I don't mind spending money on good food,  but when the baklava arrived I was surprised it was so tiny for the price. Overall a great experience. The staff were attentive without being obnoxious. They definitely don't want you to dally though,  as we felt like they increased their check in on us after we settled the bill and were just catching up talking. I would go back again to give the lamb another go.",

The waiter brought my kid a free mango lassi once when we came. Family owned and run.

The $11.95 chicken souvlaki was one skewer with 4 bite-sized pieces of chicken + veg with some tomato salad and maybe 3-4oz tzatziki.\nMy special ($16.95) was tasty, but again, I'm not sure the portion size was worth this. My friend's sandwich, the San Francisco Melt ($17.95) at least had a portion size that was filling.\n$32 for the special and the souvlaki and I was only kind of full 🤷‍♀️\nVery nice and attentive server (who was also serving a table of 10 college guys)\nNice ambience, especially for lunch with the dining room mostly empty.",

        "text": "Dropped in here unplanned. So happy we did! The restaurant was empty at around 4P on a weekday. All the food was fresh and tasted amazing. The seasoning was superb like on the Greek potatoes, and I had lots of meat on the gyro plate. The burger in the pic was ordered no cheese or mayo and it was cooked perfectly and surprisingly lean yet juicy. I must make sure to mention that the tsaziki sauce was well seasoned and the cheese on the gyro plate was plentiful as you can see.\nI got the beef soup instead of the salad and was very pleased as it was hearty and homemade. I drank the broth when it was done, of course I had to salt it but I like oversalting food.\nThe baklava was too cinnamon for us and I didn't picture it even though it was perfectly flaky. That was probably just a palate preference on our part. We had coffee and unsweetened iced tea which was a nice strong tea, obviously brewed in-house.\nWill absolutely return again!!!",

The place was really bright and airy with all the plants, which was a nice change. Maybe a little more variety in the side dishes would be good!",

That little extra crisp sets it over the top.\n\nThe flavors are on point, portions are solid, and the salsa/veggie bar they have is clutch. They’ve got curtidos (the pickled cabbage mix) and fresh salsas that actually hit.\n\nAlso, get the guava drink. Don’t think about it, just get it.\n\nTotal was only about $18 for the burrito and drink, and it keeps me full all day. If you’re anywhere near UW, this is one of those spots you’ll find yourself coming back to. Recommended 100%.\n\n(I did not finish the burrito)😅",

        "text": "If I could give this Domino’s more than 5 stars, I would.\n\nThe food is consistently perfect. Sauce actually goes all the way to the edges, my “light cheese” request is followed, and the toppings are evenly spread so every slice tastes the same. Whether I get thin crust, hand tossed, or pan, it’s baked just right- no burnt corners, no undercooked dough. The parmesan bread bites here deserve their own award; crunchy yet chewy, buttery but not greasy, with just the right amount of garlic and cheese.\n\nWhat really sets this store apart is the people. Mel is an absolute artist with pizza. Dylan is the bread-bite wizard. James, Chris, Olivia, and the rest of the crew have all made pies that are 10/10. And Noah, who I believe is managing the store, has clearly turned this place into something special- he listens to feedback, owns mistakes when they happen, and you can see his leadership in how consistent the quality has become. It's rare for anything to have a 100% hit rate but all my orders in the past 2 years or so have been consistently amazing.\n\nI’ve had pizzas all over Seattle- Pagliacci, MOD, Tutta Bella, Roccos, and more- and if I had to pick one place to eat from for the rest of my life, it would honestly be this Domino’s. I’ve celebrated birthdays, recovered from injuries, and unwound after long weeks with these pies, and more than once this stores pizza and bread bites have turned a rough day into a great night.\n\nI know this sounds dramatic for a chain pizza place, but this store really nails both food and hospitality. Friendly faces at the counter and a team that clearly cares about what they’re making. In the millions of years the universe has been around, I’m genuinely grateful I get to exist at the same time as pies this good.\n\nMy family has been eating Domino’s for generations- my grandfather, my dad, me- and I’ve tried a lot of pies over the years. This location is easily the best I’ve ever had, and is likely a big driver to why my kids when I have them will grow to loving Domino's as well.",

I love me some tomato jam so this is why I opted for the “Fast Break” sammie. It’s just sweet enough to lift the biscuit, tangy enough to keep things interesting. I wanted a pile of that tomato jam on my plate honestly. Like my other reviews I dig my sauces!!!! I’ll be back. It was very filling and I didn’t even need to eat for the rest of the day!

We got the Aladin giros, and some orange soda. You know that foods good when conversation stops. All we wanted to do was taste, and that's really saying something because we're both known yappers. My boyfriend said \"It starts at a ten, and keeps getting better.\" They should be charging a million bucks for this for how tasty it is. Very reasonable price tho for how much for you get. Great portion size, and we'll worth it. We initially came in here because we needed a restroom before eating, and the place we went to first didn't have a toilet. This was just good luck that we wandered in, but my biggest thanks goes to lady luck because this meal is SO GOOD! I'm still licking my fingers so I can get every last morsel.\nWe will be coming back next time we're in Seattle.",

The ambience is cozy and pleasant, perfect for a relaxed meal.\n\nBut the real highlight is the food—absolutely out of this world! Every dish tasted authentic, like it was straight from India. The flavors were rich, perfectly spiced, and truly satisfying. To top it off, they surprised us with complimentary halwa and mango custard, which made the experience even more special.\n\nIf you’re looking for authentic Indian food in Seattle with wonderful service, this is the place.

The flavor is incredible, and you can truly tell the food is made with love, effort, and dedication.\n\nFrom the very first day I discovered teriyaki—whether chicken, beef, or ribs—I tried many different places. Some were honestly a 2/10. But when my friends invited me to try this teriyaki spot, everything changed. Even after all these years, I never get tired of coming back. I’ve had a long food journey, and over time I’ve realized many things about this particular place.\n\n1. Homemade, delicious food\nIf you’re looking for comforting, homemade-style food where almost any dish will be delicious, this is the place. Based on my experience over these 4 years, my top recommendations are: ribs, beef, chicken, rice, takoyaki, egg rolls, miso soup, and shrimp or vegetable tempura. Every single one is consistently amazing.\n\n2. A place made with heart\nOver the years, I’ve noticed that this restaurant is truly one of the few places that is genuinely made with effort, dedication, care, and love. The owner is a kind and sweet person. If it’s your first time, you might feel a bit unsure because English isn’t his first language—but once you understand that, you’ll see how hard he tries to communicate and make sure you’re taken care of.\n\nIf you’re a kind and patient person, you’ll immediately understand that he’s simply someone working hard to move forward and break the language barrier. I’ve known him for 4 years now, and even though we don’t exchange many words, it’s very clear that he’s incredibly kind, caring, and genuine—just a bit introverted.\n\n3. An unforgettable family experience\nI also brought my family here while they were visiting on vacation, and everyone was able to enjoy this delicious food. My brother and my dad are extremely open to trying food from different cultures, especially Asian cuisine. My brother, who has tried countless restaurants—even in other countries—had never tasted rice with such an incredible flavor. He enjoyed it so much that he ended up eating four plates of rice because he absolutely loved it.\n\nThey were also amazed by the flavor of every dish we tried, including the takoyaki, egg rolls, and most of the menu. That time, we ordered one of almost everything so we could try the variety, and everyone was completely impressed. That was two years ago, and to this day, every time we try a new restaurant, they still mention this place and say that without a doubt, the food here is unforgettable and incredibly delicious.\n\nThis place isn’t just about good food; it’s about heart. I will continue coming back without a doubt.",

        "text": "Absolute gem. Had a delicious chicken curry katsu that took me straight back to Japan. The curry was flavorful with tender veggies, the chicken crispy and juicy, and the rice was perfectly cooked and almost sticky.\n\nIt even came with a side salad or miso soup, and all for a very reasonable price! Hard to find any food around Seattle that matches this quality and quantity.\n\nThe service was very brief and of few words, which as someone who has been to Japan I can appreciate. The chef / owner came out of the kitchen as I was leaving to thank / say goodbye, which is awesome and reminded me of restaurants in Japan.\n\nSurprisingly, I was the only person in for lunch at the time. I think more people should try this place.",

Giant plate of beef fried rice for $13 AND comes with some of the best miso soup I’ve ever had. Shared with my S/O and filled us up. Everything is hand made down to the onions in the soup and made fresh. If you’re genuinely looking for a place to check out TRY THIS. They only have one person doing it all and we should give him some love. Genuinely so good guys.",

It's a shame I never came here before, but I'm happy that after several years in the U District I finally decided to stop in. All staff were incredibly friendly, the price was a steal, the food was beyond delicious, the service was speedy, and honestly I don't think I could say a single thing they need to improve on at all! They even were incredibly patient with my 9 year old sister who my wife and I were watching for the night, and brought a smile to her face with their aquarium and friendliness. If I could rate 6 stars, I would.\n\nI recommend anyone looking for delicious fish, chicken, or beef burgers/sandwiches: visit this place ASAP! You won't regret it!\n\nTo the owner(s): thank you so much - you were wonderful and I hope to see you again very soon. ♥️",

The noodles were chewy, soup was flavorful, and the herbs and cilantro helps cut through the fatty taste keeping it tasty bite after bite. Would definitely come here every so often since it's a simple classic favorite for myself. Only caveat is the place is on the smaller side.\n\nIn terms of ordering, it's a straightforward kiosk and you place your order at the machine. Nice and no fuss process to get your order or even order online for pickup. Great for introverts if you want something non-conversational.\n\nIf I remember correctly, bowl was about 17$ a bowl. Kind of normal in this day and age unfortunately, but still worth the price for me.",

Also can be a lot spicier.\n\nThey aren’t cheap but the portions were pretty huge especially the beef slices. I also ordered the flaky pancake to go with the soup - the ultimate way to enjoy both the pancake and the soup is to soak it in the soup and eat it. 😋\n\nWill definitely be coming back.\n\nPS everything is self service - from ordering to picking up the food to busing your own table.",

I ordered a zoodle bowl with creamy scallops and spicy tuna. plus their citrus ponzu and special aioli (forgot the name) and toppings galore! really love this place and the staff member, he didn't skimp out on any toppings and gave me a generous helping of the ones I particularly liked 😋. could have helped that I came close to closing (9pm). and they had a really good variety of fresh and delicious toppings like pineapple, mango, spicy crab meat, tomago, kimchi, and seaweed salad\nPLUS! the crunchies!!! so many delicious crunchies including tempura, furikake, crispy garlic and crispy onion. loved it, great experience. 10/10 will definitely be returning!",

But I think 9/10 times I come here I’m probably getting the toast (Korean style sandwich). No hate to those other things, and while we have had plenty of kbbq and soondubu places in the U-District, this is the only place making the legit toast like in SK.\n\nThe sandwich comes like a tower - impossibly tall, with a huge cabbage and egg patty in the center that’s covered in cheese, ketchup and mustard. The sandwich comes with a knife and fork on the side, almost like they anticipate most humans cannot unhinge their jaw like a python to take a bite of that thing.\n\nTheres a trend of modern Korean food to add a lot of sweetness to savory dishes to create that sweet-salty flavor (“단짠단짠“), I appreciate they hold back some of the sweetness here. There are some versions of this toast that literally coat one slice in sugar like a pastry, and while people love it, it takes some getting used to. So props to them for understanding the American palate here, there is a little sweetness in the sandwich, mostly from the ketchup, but balanced and not at all overwhelming.\n\nLast note - my friend got tteokguk and when I tried her broth I could really taste the dashi stock - it’s obvious it’s been legit made with kelp and anchovy. No corners cut.\n\nAlso, service was good and everyone there is really nice.",

Don’t be deterred by the metal dog bowl it is served in. I would recommend pairing it very with a Coors Light and a Mariner’s win.",

We ordered the Mapo Tofu, and from the very first bite, my mouth went numb — definitely a unique experience.\nWe came on a Sunday during brunch with a party of two. The place was spacious, and we got seated right away even though there were already a few tables filled. Each table has a QR code to order from your phone, which I thought was a clever idea.\nA few dishes showed as unavailable when ordering online, but when we asked the server, he said they actually had them. The server was very accommodating, especially considering it seemed like he was the only one serving.\nThe food overall was a bit on the salty side, but the crispy pancake with beef and cilantro stood out the most — the mix of sweetness from the sauce and savory beef was really good.",

That’s a dangerous trifecta that’ll make this boy phat!!!\n\nSo I decided to check this place out while I was in the area. Saw the prices online which is good of them to share and thought it was standard for seattle and others I’ve had for a full soup. (Not tofu soup)\nFirst off, the service was very attentive and quick! Everything was clean and had a great atmosphere. Music is via their iPhone I think so if you hear back to back versions of cannon, don’t worry. It’ll change up as they noonchi the situation.\nWhen the soup came out I was at awe!!! So much content. So soupy. And the spice was right on point!\nThe side dishes were all fresh. (Pending on if you like it fresh or not but it was pretty good fresh - I like mine a bit older)\n\nFor what you get, it’s amazing. And the quality and flavor. 🤤 so good. On top of that, service an atmosphere. I’ve covered these points three times in this review cause it’s that good. I wish I lived in the neighborhood 😭 I’ll be back!!! Thank you!!!",

Outside noise is okay--not terrible but not quiet, either.\n\nMy complaint is that upon checking in I received no information about the amenities such as where the restaurants are, where the ice machines are located (the even floors--found this out by calling the front desk), and how to use the supposed 15 dollars a day we are supposed to get for staying here--never did learn how to use this).\n\nUpon checking in I was handed a card in an envelope with my room number but not told what floor I was on--I guessed and was right. I was also not told (and no signage) that one has to press the room key to a black plastic beveled box on the wall to get the elevator to input my room number. Again, maybe just basic information that could have been communicated either with the front desk or with signage in the elevator.\n\nThe room itself has zero information about the hotel--no printed docs or even a QR code to scan to learn more. I had to call the front desk to learn where the exercise room is--Mezzanine level  (which the front desk clerk then condescendingly explained to me as I suppose someone over 50 must not understand). I had no idea about the restaurants in the hotel--where they are located, hours, or menu--no information at check-in and no information in the room). The check-in was okay, but I definitely received the vibe of \"I couldn't care less about you or your stay.: I'm over 50 and female, but I dress well, shower daily, of sound mind and body, and articulate. I present as a normal professional adult.  Not sure why I deserved so little information or consideration.",

Our room looked nothing like the photos, and it smelled old and musty. For charging upwards of $400 a night, this place i not worth it. There are no fridges or microwaves in the rooms. But if you ask the front desk, they will bring you a mini fridge. Jolene was an excellent help with that. The restaurant and rooftop terrace that they advertise are less than up to par.

Outer layer is soft, very eggy serves with the shredded duck inside  and the crispy fried stick. They also spreaded a chili sauce inside. So savory and have a good kick.\n\nGreat food, great price, great portion - I would go back :)",

Only critic is black sugar tofu pudding can be all cold, the tofu was warm but black sugar was cold so it took away from it a bit. But for a dessert it’s pretty good. A plus for the good playlist.",

It is very delicious, warm and filling. The soup base is very clear and tastes nice!\n\nAppearance: The pho looks amazing and l couldn't ask for more! Looking so cute!\n\nPortion size: I ordered a large and finished the whole bowl by myself haha! I honestly would appreciate more meats and noodles. That would be more filling and satisfying for the customers! But I also understand that the cost of everything is rising so it might be difficult for them to increase the portion size.\n\n🙂Service: 9/10🙂\n\nFriendliness: Very nice service! I love the smile of the waitress and she is really warm and welcoming. Great service!\n\nTimeliness: The pho that I ordered came in no time, I honestly don't remember even waiting for 2 minutes and the pho is in front of me!  I really appreciate that as I was super hungry LOL!\n\nEnvironment: A clean and nice space with perfect lighting and decors! The lighting is not too bright and set the tone of the bistro, it's kinda giving a feeling of being home. I also loved how they decorated this place with plants and cute stuff! I also love the background music that was playing too!\n\nLocation: Great location for many UW students as it was just on the ave. Very easy to locate and within walkable distance to many apartments and houses. It might be quite hard to find street parkings but people came and go all the time! Very convenient location since it is 5 minutes away from the lightrail station as well!",

        "text": "I think the root of the problem here is that this place is understaffed. There were only two servers running back and forth so it took a while to get seated despite many open tables. When we were seated, our grill plate still had some charred bits stuck to it from previous cooks.\n\nWe always order brisket to start at kbbq because it cooks the fastest, however something was wrong with our grill so it was taking forever to cook. We tried messing with the dial but nothing could get the fire hotter. Eventually a waiter came over and told us that they'd been having troubles with that grill so we could move to another table. At this point, we'd been there about an hour and had barely eaten so we moved and that grill worked a lot better. It was frustrating that they even sat us at the known problem grill in the first place.\n\nThe meats were just okay and they gave us very little sauce to dip them in. It was also difficult getting a hold of a server to refill anything or order more meat. I will not be coming back here.\n\nLimited street parking only in this area but you should be able to find a spot pretty easily within only a couple blocks of the restaurant.",

They surprised us with complimentary mini samosas, served with so much care, and even after we had settled the bill, they kindly asked us to stay a little longer to enjoy a free dessert. In today’s world of rising costs, this level of generosity is both rare and deeply appreciated.\n\nThe samosas were golden, crisp, and perfectly spiced — each bite felt like a small journey back to India. The chai tasted exactly like homemade tea, and the team continued offering tea refills to every table with genuine warmth and attentiveness.\n\nThe aloo paranthas were outstanding — flavorful, well-seasoned, and truly authentic, just like you’d find in India. The chefs are attentive to personal preferences and prepare every dish with care, while the servers create magic through their thoughtful service.\n\nWhat made the experience even more special was seeing people from all backgrounds gathered, enjoying Indian food and tea together. This restaurant represents Indian culture and hospitality in the most beautiful way.\n\nTaste of India truly shines as one of Seattle’s proud culinary treasures.\nA must-visit for anyone seeking not only wonderful food, but a memorable and heartfelt dining experience.",

The crust has the perfect amount of char and would be delicious even without the scrumptious tomato sauce.

The flavor was bold and smoky, the vegan chick’n had the perfect texture, and the sauce brought everything together perfectly. You honestly wouldn’t even miss the meat or dairy. The crust was that ideal balance between crispy and chewy, and you could tell they use high-quality ingredients in everything they make. Their attention to detail really sets them apart. Even the staff was super friendly and took the time to explain different options on the menu. You can feel the passion behind the food here. Whether you’re vegan, vegetarian, or just curious, this spot will blow you away. I’m already looking forward to coming back and trying more!",

We were not aware that this place was overtaken by new owners.\nWe hoped to enjoy the same delicious food we have been enjoying for several years coming to this restaurant.\nUpon entering this restaurant, we were met with a very potent, unpleasant smell, that we couldn't identify what it was. The smell lingered the entire time and honestly, made me nauseous.\nThe interior now is more as of simple, casual, and somehow felt empty and arrayed. The two servers (a man and a woman), seemed confused and uncoordinated in serving guests. The food I ordered (single skewer chicken with rice) was completely tasteles, dry... The rice in particular had no flavor; tasted as it was made of paper, and I am questioning the color on it being saffron, rather a food coloring, perhaps??? I was unable to complete my single chicken kabob skewer and barely few bites of rice, and had no interest of asking for a box to take it home with me. We also decided to order a tea, and the tea was also blant.\nNeedless to say, we were super disappointed with our visit to this newly owned restaurant that we very much loved in the past.\nI would not consider coming back, nor I would recommend it to anyone.",

I was curious if I had just been romanticizing my memory of how delicious this place was. NOPE! It's extraordinary!!!! This time, I ordered the lunch special and am just amazed at how absolutely delicious each bite is even after I'm full.

Which makes it a very convenient location, and there are plenty of parking outside the bar, but this may not be the case if the neighborhood is busy on a Friday or weekend evening! I also enjoyed the very local-bar like decor in the bar! It was a  ice highlight!",

        "text": "I really like this chain of sushi and Japanese cuisine restaurants. On Sunday we tried to visit their location in Lynnwood, but it was completely full, so we decided to come here instead. We had never been to this location before. We booked a table online, but when we arrived the place was almost empty.\n\nThe dining area is small, and the buffet is also small, but everything is clean, with no unpleasant smells. The atmosphere is cozy and comfortable, although it felt a bit chilly. The dishes were served quickly — here the food is brought by a server, not a robot like in some of their other locations. The ordering system is the same: every 15 minutes you can order up to 15 items.\n\nThe menu is similar to other restaurants in this chain. The portions are quite large: big pieces of fish, big rolls, and plenty of fish overall. We enjoyed everything, and if we decide to visit this chain again, I would probably choose this location rather than wait in line for half an hour at the others",

The rolls were yummy, love the 4 rolls per order, that way you don’t get too full. The sashimi we chose were sooooo good. We also ordered the ramen and a few hand rolls. We loved the self-serve bar. There were so many choices available and made it easy to grab things like ginger/wasabi/miso soup as needed. The self-serve thai tea with topping options was also a plus. Would definitely come back!",

Service was super friendly and quick, and the place felt clean, which is always a good sign.\n\nMost of the food was great—sushi came out fresh and tasty. Only downside was the shrimp in the shabu shabu, which wasn’t as fresh as I’d like. Everything else hit the spot though.\nPricing is fair too. Weekend price is the same as dinner, so you don’t get charged extra just for going on a Saturday or Sunday.\nOverall, a good go-to for AYCE sushi if you’re around campus.",

I understand that the workers might have been busy at around night time but creating a welcoming space and not being told without question to go to the self-serve tablets would’ve been nice.\n\nOnce I got my drink, I found the taste fairly yummy but most of all difficult to drink. If you get a drink with seeds in them, expect to be crunching on those bitter seeds all night making up most of the drink experience than anything else. I ended up throwing away my drink 1/3 completed because it was too difficult to enjoy. If there is an option to drink it without all of the seeds, I think that’d be nice!\n\nOther than that, the space is well decorated and has lots of open space to enjoy your boba with friends. They also provide games too and a bathroom! However, because of the service and distaste for the drink, it was not one of my favorite spots as a visitor in Washington.",

As other reviews have detailed, YiFang really needs to improve the flavor of their milk tea and matcha. I got the regular matcha and here is a side by side comparison of the YiFang matcha with Starbucks. Starbucks is not even a very high quality itself but Yifang falls far below even that. You can tell visually that the quality of the drink is poor, and since ice was unadjustable, I ended up with a drink that was overly sweet even at 30% sugar, bitter, dusty, and watery (as the drink was mostly melted ice). As a matcha lover Yifang is not the place to visit.",

When I finally got my food the portions were really skimped, meat smelled old, 40% of it was veggie to meat ratio, and food was not even good. On top of everything considering how much I spent, I genuinely feel like I got robbed.",

We ordered the Korean Fried Chicken with Snow Onion flavor, the Rose Tteok Bokki and the Truffle Fries. As for the snow wings, it could use a little more onions on it. For the price to portion it’s not worth it at all. We paid $51.84 for it. Like you can honestly get huge portions of the same thing across at CM chicken but you get like huge pieces. The owners are nice to gave us a side dish of their macaroni salad which was so good but still not worth the price.",

The salmon nigiris here are the best I’ve had, and I’ve had a lot of nigiris  across Korea / Japan / US. The rice is perfectly made and fish is fresh & always at the right temperature. The rolls also always have the perfect rice to fish ratio. The atmosphere is super cozy and fun - the walls are full of interesting arts and music related decors. The music in the background is also always great taste. The sushi chef seems like such a sweet person.",

Additionally, the side dishes are terrific - the tempura is crisp, light, and never greasy, the scallop appetizer is a bit of heaven - make sure to order rice with it to pair with the leftover sauce, and the agedashi tofu, which is my standard by which I test new places, is the best!  All of this at remarkably reasonable prices.\nVillage Sushi is in a modest spot on the north end of University Way. Joe always has jazz playing, the lights a bit dimmed and you are surrounded by paintings he has done offering an interesting peak into his life away from the restaurant.

I with they had more items to choose from, that is my only knock on it. When I went it was between lunch and dinner and they brought out the 3 meats from the freezer I’m guessing to keep them fresh instead of sitting in the refrigerator?\n\nA lot of handwritten notes here which leads me to believe it’s a mom and pop operation and a no frills menu. No dry style like most malangtang.\n\nSauce bar has all the basics.\n\nParking is so so in the area but free 2hr street parking.\n\nOverall the broth to me is one of the best and the amount of soup they give you is more than other places which are the bright notes and the draw to this place.",

Their tomato broth is creamy and full of flavor, and reminds me of those high end hot pot places where their broth just hits. Super fresh ingredients and they have a sauce bar so I’m sold!!!\n\nWith any Malatang place you gotta be a pro at how much you put into your bowl or you will be spending more than $20.\n\nThe second time I came in, they were quite packed on a Sunday evening. Coming back to try their other broths for sure.",

The staff were super friendly and attentive to our needs, providing helpful tips when needed. The atmosphere was great with a lot of people standing around with big smiles on their faces as they ate. And the food was amazing!!\n\nWe had three dishes and literally everything was a 12/10. We started with the takoyaki which was super flavorful and a great deal. Then the popcorn chicken was succulent and came with more than expected for the price. Then finally, THE UNAGIDON WAS FIREEE!! The unagi was super fresh, melting in the mouth and it was such a perfect meal for our Sunday afternoon.\n\nI can’t recommend this spot enough! We’ll definitely be back soon.",

        "text": "Stopped by after work on a Saturday night to eat, around 6:45. I ordered their Seattle Restaurant Week deal which included the curry katsudon, a side (I chose takoyaki), and a drink (oolong tea or milk tea).\n\nHonestly the value was pretty decent. \"Katsudon\" was solid with thick, juicy pieces of cutlet, and the rice was topped with some furikake so I could eat as is, but you can add the curry which had some potato and carrot pieces. I personally used the curry as a dip for the katsu. The takoyaki was pretty standard, and the milk tea was just okay.\n\nMy main issue was that the order took over 20 minutes after placing it at the kiosk. While waiting for my order, I could see other people standing by the counter waiting for their orders also. Not sure if the restaurant was having an off day, insufficiently staffed (I saw two people working), or still sorting out things during their soft opening period.",

When we arrived, the drinks hadn’t been made yet and the store wasn’t busy. No explanation, no apologize, no customer service.\n\nAfter the staff finally made our order, they left it aside on the window without calling us, and no one helped with bringing them to somewhere we can reach until we finally asked after 5 minutes waiting at the reception desk. I’m sure the staffs knew we were there waiting! They are not even busy! One of the staff just sat next to the window. The whole process was disorganized and wasted a lot of time.\n\nThe taste of the drink changes in a bad way. They don’t taste like what we used to have.",

Might be because they are new, but it took us a lot longer to get our food than it does at Maggi Point. Looking forward to visiting more and seeing if that aspect improves.\n\nOther than that, the resturaunt was clean, the Bollywood mural/theme was cute, the service was friendly, and the taste of everything we ordered was great. Also love that they play panjabi hits in the resturaunt - feels like home lol!\n\nWould recommend giving it a try, we’ll definitely be back to try some more items.",

Surprisingly, the sweetness level is just right for my taste, not overly sweet.\n\n🥘 Mr. And Mrs.Smith\nTheir house-made chili oil is aromatic but not too spicy. Each bite of beef tendon and shank is flavorful and satisfying.\n\n🍜 Braised Beef Noodles\nPacked with tender beef and topped with fragrant chili oil, this bowl is a flavor bomb. The crispy chickpeas add a fun texture twist!\n\n🦑 Fried Calamari Rings\nHandmade daily by the chef, these rings are crispy and delicious. A must-have when you’re indulging in seafood!\n\n🦐 Seafood Broil\nThe star of the show! Their house sauce is absolutely amazing. We ordered the mild version to accommodate family members who don’t eat spicy food, and it was still super flavorful. One pound of shrimp and scallops was more than enough, and they’re currently offering a deal: order any seafood broil and get free clams. Great value!\n\n🎉 We also happened to visit during their grand opening promotion—10% off the entire bill! Definitely worth checking out while the deal lasts.",

The food is great and since their relaunch they’ve put in ample effort. I’ve been a loyal regular for almost 5 years and am so thankful they’re still going. This is a great place to enjoy wholesome and healthy plant based foods and treats. It’s a nice place to hang out, work or talk. Bathrooms are good.",

Short line before we ordered Pacific Blue (Tuna Melt) and The Kind (Turkey, Bacon & Shrooms) sandwiches with chips and a sweet tea and a blue raspberry Kool Aid. My wife thoroughly enoughed her Pacific Blue sandwich, the tuna itself was high quality and paired really well with the toasted garlic bread. My The Kind sandwich was good although slightly dry, next time I'll add some type of sauce to it but otherwise very flavorful and filling (my wife's tuna sandwich was a nug and my sandwich size was a pinner). The blueberry Kool Aid was outstanding, not overly sweet and the goo ball was the perfect gooey dessert treat for lunch. Great music selection playing overhead and a special shoutout to Diego for making it all go down! Definitely a recommend spot for tasty toasty subs that are quite filling whenever you're in the U District.",

My sandwich was luke warmand there was literally turkey, cheese, 1 broken slices of bacon, 1 broken slices of avocado, lots of lettuce,  bland Chipotle, 2 slices of jalapeño,  pickle spears.  No tomatoes no onions and absolutely no flavor or spice.  I can make a better sandwich at home.\nThe music was so loud it was hard to communicate with the girl taking our order.  She had absolutely no people skills or personality either.\nAll the bright lights and loud music doesn't make a restaurant.   It's the food and the people.   Epic fail and we will not return.   I'll go to Subway if I want an over priced flavorless sandwich.",

We got mild garlic spice, curry, soy garlic, snow onion, cheese monster, and hot honey. Overall the food taste was 4/5. Flavorful wings with a good crunch. However, I could not sleep at night because the food gave me horrible stomachache with cramps… I thought maybe it was just a bad day for me but the next day I had some left overs again and again I could not sleep because of bad stomachaches and cramps. This lasted probably for 36 hours… This also happened to my other friends who tried it too. Sad to say I prob won’t come back even though the chicken was so good… 😔",

Knew this chain when I went to Florida and snow wings was all I remembered. 🫡 When I saw CM I never jumped so fast to come in and ordered the snow wings to go.\n\nDid not disappoint at all since the chicken from CM as always is super crispy, huge and that special snow onion sauce they doused on their chicken is to die for.\n\nSo had to come back to dine in and gosh you gotta dine in here so you can experience the freshly fried crispness of the chicken. Giving it a 4 stars because maybe the dining in experience compared to Florida is just a tad behind here.

There are 9 different kinds sashimi in the box, every piece is FRESH, it doesn’t have the smell usually associated with fish. Secondly, the Chawanmushi you gotta try it out as well. There are chef-made truffle sauce, salmon roe and uni on the top, the steam egg is super tender and smooth, there are two little shrimp at the bottom, very tasty and the texture is full of layers. Order a bottle sake pairing with these food will be wrap up the dinner. 100/100 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟",

I get my water refill  and even a quick presentation about each beautiful entrée courses.\nI went on a Saturday night 10pm, it was busy and lucky we took the last available table. Every dishes was prepare thoughtfully and well executed. Most importantly, I Like to address about the prices. It’s slightly in the higher end if you were to compare all the restaurants in the University way. However, you truly get the top quality seafood of what you paid for. Reviewers complaining about the price point aren’t understanding how restaurants have to go thur to prepare fresh ingredients at the same time beating the horrible inflation.\nThis place is perfect for group gathering and for special occasions like when you ace your tough exams!! I highly recommend this place.",

The nature of their design makes it easy to try something new, without having to commit to an entire bowl of it.\nUpon entering, you’re invited to pick up a bowl and tongs and select from a wide selection of veggies, seafood, and meats. Fill your bowl with what you know you’ll love and then select a piece or two of something new to you. Your bowl is weighed and you’re asked to choose a broth and spice level. You pay and are given a number.\nYou are able to watch them prepare your soup or find a table. When your meal is ready, an automated voice twice says your number. Even at super busy times, it’s easy to hear. Pick up your bowl and take it to the finishing station to add your personal touches.

Go give this place your business!\n\nWe had the Butter Chicken Pizza & Paneer Tikka Pizza and both were phenomenal. Light and airy crust without feeling too heavy but still filling. Served piping hot (we dined in) and we also got a taste of their churro bites, which were oh so soft and sweet.\n\nThe staff are extremely sweet and friendly and service was fast as well. Highly recommend and we'll be back for more!",

Their pies are 🔥 fresh, creative, and loaded with toppings (the Butter Chicken and Chicken Tikka Masala pizzas are absolute standouts). The crust strikes that perfect balance of chewy and crisp, and every bite feels intentional and bold. The vibe is laid-back and friendly, and the service felt personal and welcoming — almost like getting pizza from a buddy who actually cares. With a top-tier menu and rave reviews all around, this spot is quickly climbing my Seattle pizza favorites list. 10/10 — come hungry! 🍕💥",

        "text": "I really enjoyed my experience here! Not the most flavorful Indian food I've ever had, but it's a fusion place so that's what I expected, and for the price I don't think you can beat it.\n\nI got a 6 inch butter chicken sub. It's the biggest 6 inch sandwich I've ever had! The sauce was not the most flavorful, but still tasty, and the bread was perfect (soft on the inside, crispy flaky on the outside), and the chicken itself was cooked very well. There was also a generous amount of cheese, and onion and green bell peppers added a nice touch. For only $7 (before taxes/tips) I don't think I've had such a tasty and filling sandwich.\n\nAfterwards I decided to get ice cream. They have a good selection of Western and Indian flavors. I wanted to try all of them, but could only eat a bit, so I ordered one scoop. But for the price of one he gave me two!\n\nAlso I saw previous reviews mentioned there was no water? But currently they offer both bottled and cup water. And for me the service was very fast, and the man behind the counter was so nice.\n\nThe one recommendation I have for the place would be to play some music. When I visited there was no music and very few people. I think they should be more popular, though!",

        "text": "Really disappointing experience. Service was painfully slow, and the staff seemed uninterested. When the food finally arrived, it was underwhelming. One dish even had a hair in it — completely unacceptable and raises serious hygiene concerns.\n\nI ordered the Bombay vegetarian sandwich expecting something flavorful and known taste. What I got was just cheese and olives slapped between bread with a tiny piece of capsicum — no spice, no chutney, no vegetables. It felt lazy and totally disconnected from what the name promised.\n\nThere was no drinking water available — not even bottled water for sale. For a restaurant serving food, this is shocking. Even a cooler with water bottles would’ve been better than nothing.\n\nBetween the poor service, sub-par food, and lack of basic amenities, this visit was a total letdown. Definitely not worth the time or money, and I won’t be returning.",

It's more like in Indian spiced kung pao chicken in a bread roll with melted cheese. Anyway it was freaking awesome but watch out it was like 3.5 stars of spiciness halfway through it really builds on you. Luckily I asked for some mint chutney on the side which they gave me complimentary, and was perfect to dip into as I ate it. The cooling effect of the chimney saved me from the spiciness.

The white sauce was creamy and rich without being heavy, and the hot sauce added the perfect kick. Portions were generous and totally worth the price. You can tell they care about quality and freshness here. Definitely my go-to spot whenever I’m craving something satisfying and flavorful!",

        "text": "Amazing authentic atmosphere, it reminds me of being invited into a welcoming home kitchen. The Owner is genuine and kind as he cooks his dishes in an open kitchen with passion for his food and his culture. The quality of Halal (Answering to a higher standard of quality for meats and dairy) food and the freshness of ingredients cannot be matched even in a five star resteraunt. The combination of added spices in the saffron rice humbled me as I could only guess 5 of the spices used...the rest are family tradition secrets. I have worked in 5 star resteraunts as a chef and I could not match the flavor combination of perfection. We had the #3 and the #9 paired with the Salaam cola (similar to Coke original taste, but better) for lunch. We were completely satisfied with each ingredient and paring the Owner suggested and applied to his craft for cooking. The price for 2 dishes $18 and $13 respectively. Outstanding value for the amount of food and quality you receive.\nIn my humble opinion, come here if you seek authentic food at great value cooked by truly amazing people.\n\nShaka Bruddah!",

The  baba ghanoush is really garlicky and delicious, the cauliflower is fried just enough to be crispy. The hummus is pretty delicious as a good as home made. They added 3 different delicious  sauces which really added a lot of flavor to the food!!",

The sauces were spot on and really brought everything together without overpowering the taste. Portions were generous and well worth the price.\nThe place was clean and welcoming, and the staff were friendly and quick, even during busy hours. You can tell they care about quality and consistency. If you’re craving a delicious, satisfying shawarma made right, Shawarma Time is definitely the place to go. Highly recommended!",

The food is decent some dishes have good flavor, but overall, it lacks the consistency and boldness I expect from a place specializing in shawarma. Service has been hit or miss during my visits. Sometimes the staff is attentive, other times it feels like they’re just not very engaged. The place is clean and has a modern vibe, but nothing particularly memorable stands out. If you’re nearby and craving shawarma, it’s a convenient option, but it wouldn’t be my first choice. Hopefully with a few improvements, it can live up to its potential.",
